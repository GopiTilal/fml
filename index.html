       <li>A dad’s role in a child’s well-being is very important.Fathers teach many important lessons to a child,<br>
         like how to be affectionate and supportive, and how to take care of everyone else by giving the best example,<br>
         and all of this while being great examples themselves.</li>
       <li>Fathers are great caretakers, they make their little ones feel safe and secure,<br>
         they teach their little ones to ride bikes, to jump higher, and to always aim for the best.</li>
       <li>This is why is so important to recognize the labor of all of those involved fathers,<br>
         that are day by day supporting their families.</li>
